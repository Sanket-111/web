                        <p>Walchand College Of Engineering, Sangli is an autonomous Institution.

                            Walchand College of Engineering is situated midway between Sangli and Miraj cities at
                            Vishrambag, Sangli. The WCE campus is located on about 90 acres of land on southern side of
                            Sangli – Miraj road.

                            In 1947, the college made a modest beginning as New Engineering College, with a single
                            program leading to B.E. (Civil) degree. In the year 1955, the College was renamed as
                            Walchand College of Engineering as part of the new arrangements and pursuant to the
                            Rehabilitation and Development Program mainly funded by Seth Walchand Hirachand Memorial
                            Trust and the Government. The Government appointed an Ad Hoc Committee for conducting the
                            college from May 1955, later replaced by the Administrative Council in 1956. The Ad Hoc
                            Committee added two more degree programs in B.E. (Mechanical) and B.E. (Electrical) in 1955
                            with the intake of 20 each. Three Diploma programs also started in 1955 – Civil (40 intake),
                            Mechanical (20) and Electrical (20).
